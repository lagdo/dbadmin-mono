A database admin dashboard based on Jaxon and Adminer
=====================================================

Jaxon DbAdmin is a complete rewrite of [Adminer](https://github.com/vrana/adminer), the popular database admin dashboard.

Jaxon DbAdmin is a [Jaxon package](https://www.jaxon-php.org/docs/v5x/extensions/packages.html), that is inserted into a page of an existing PHP application.
So it's also a single page application, and all its operations are performed with Ajax requests.

Separate packages provide ready-to-use applications which run Jaxon DbAdmin respectively with the [Laravel](https://github.com/lagdo/dbadmin-app-laravel), [Symfony](https://github.com/lagdo/dbadmin-app-symfony) and [Slim](https://github.com/lagdo/dbadmin-app-slim) frameworks.
This blog post on the Jaxon website explains how to install Jaxon DbAdmin on [Backpack](https://backpackforlaravel.com), a Laravel-based admin panel: [https://www.jaxon-php.org/blog/2025/07/install-jaxon-dbadmin-on-backpack.html](https://www.jaxon-php.org/blog/2025/07/install-jaxon-dbadmin-on-backpack.html).

The database access code (and thus the provided features) originates from [Adminer](https://github.com/vrana/adminer).
The original code was refactored to take advantage of the latest PHP features (namespaces, interfaces, DI, and so on), and separated into multiple Composer packages.
- [https://github.com/lagdo/dbadmin-driver](https://github.com/lagdo/dbadmin-driver): common classes and interfaces for the database drivers.
- [https://github.com/lagdo/dbadmin-driver-pgsql](https://github.com/lagdo/dbadmin-driver-pgsql): the database driver for PostgreSQL.
- [https://github.com/lagdo/dbadmin-driver-mysql](https://github.com/lagdo/dbadmin-driver-mysql): the database driver for MySQL and MariaDB.
- [https://github.com/lagdo/dbadmin-driver-sqlite](https://github.com/lagdo/dbadmin-driver-sqlite): the database driver for SQLite.

The [https://github.com/lagdo/jaxon-dbadmin](https://github.com/lagdo/jaxon-dbadmin) package implements the database management features in a [Jaxon package](https://www.jaxon-php.org/docs/v5x/extensions/packages.html).
Its UI is built with the [https://github.com/lagdo/ui-builder](https://github.com/lagdo/ui-builder) package, which will provide support for multiple frontend frameworks.
[Bootstrap 5](https://github.com/lagdo/ui-builder-bootstrap5) is the default.

This repo is the monorepo where the database packages are developed.
